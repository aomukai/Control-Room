# Audit Ledger

Legend:
- Status: `[ ]` open | `[~]` partial | `[x]` verified once | `[X]` confirmed
- Severity: `P0` must fix / `P1` should fix / `P2` nice
- Implementation: `I0` not implemented / `I1` stub-partial / `I2` MVP / `I3` polished
- Verification: `CODE-MATCH` / `RUNTIME-VERIFIED` / `UNKNOWN`

Rules:
- Every entry must include a doc anchor and an evidence receipt.
- FAIL/UNKNOWN entries must include an acceptance test.
